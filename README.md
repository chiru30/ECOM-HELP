# ECOM-HELP
One of the fast growing trends of todayâ€™s world is E-commerce. Along with its uses and advancements , there comes a problem of package delivery and appropriate delivery times. Most E-commerce websites today still doesnt enable the option of delivery date tracking and confirmation on the date. Due to COVID as the E-commerce websites took a rapid increase in their user stats, this project is a small help for all the people out there to have a confirmation on their delivery date to avoid any issues or problems while receiving the package.

Broad Scope - Based on the data study , I noticed a relationship between discount offered and delivery reach . More the discount offered , more were the chances of delay. This can be looked into from the company's end to adopt better strategies and techniques to overcome this issue.
